         <para>The recommendation here is to build a glossary database (Chapter 17 of Stayton's
                  book) that is writable by any author or editor with commit privileges. Authors can
                  populate it with whatever terms they like, using a simple rule for id
                  disambiguation (such as gloss.term, where gloss is constant and term is the term
                  itself). If we need to disambiguate two forms of the same term, we can add a
                  suffix. The build process described in Stayton's book builds a glossary for each
                  document based on the terms used in that document.</para>

         <para>For authors without commit privileges, this becomes a little more complex. One
                  thought would be to have authors submit their glossary entries in a separate file,
                  which editor-committers can then upload.</para>
